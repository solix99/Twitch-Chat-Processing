[0:17:01] tacti_kat: There is a strong possibility I am talking right out of my ass, But I think they paused the chronicles of Rhyzy season 2 because all the devs are now working on the patch queue I was talking to a buddy about it and he reminded me that Nikita said all the actors were devs
[0:17:06] SailYourFace: grenade daddy
[0:17:25] nickhmbr: streamers server btw kek

[0:25:22] krythic_: Jesse's pizza sounds like some dollar store offbrand pizza.
[0:25:29] ReverseRoll: eh i wasnt listening
[0:25:38] grumpypantsttv: Gotcha
[0:25:41] tiz_remz: youre offbrand... LUL
[0:25:43] ReverseRoll: mrs was a pain and decided to talk to me
[0:25:44] krythic_: THe kind of pizza that tastes more like cardboard than pizza.
[0:25:50] ReverseRoll: ahh
[0:26:00] leadsprayer_89: do you think the next wipe will be the unity update @JesseKazam
[0:26:03] krythic_: Haha
[0:26:07] xSittinherex: note: remind jesse video at 3
[0:26:20] stunpymidget: Nahhh your marcos
[0:26:28] xSittinherex: Hey siri, remind me to remind jesse so I don‚Äôt forget so remind me at 3
[0:26:36] Zilinity: Do they have an approximate date for this summers wipe? I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôm back from my deployment before it happens
[0:26:39] boxofrockets: Naahhh I hope they don‚Äôt wipe until the content
[0:26:53] Zilinity: Wifi sucks so I can read the dates sorry @jessekazam
[0:27:16] Gunwaltz: They definitely shouldn't wipe it with unity 2021 give it a couple months to iron it out
[0:27:47] hk9987: does anyone know if that region lock thing is still active? a budddy from the US asked me to help him with a few quests
[0:27:49] derized: They might have to wipe with that tech wise
[0:27:55] xSittinherex: Depends on how much change with unity 21
[0:27:56] Swedepiie: This game always wipes when I‚Äôm on my cabin vacation so wipe will be sometime july 1- July 24 lol
[0:27:57] shmooexe: hey jessy glad catch you streaming! hope you are doing well and having a good stream!

[0:28:27] tiz_remz: dumb dumnb ?
[0:28:27] Gunwaltz: Aye me too I just guess and hope for the best
[0:28:32] stunpymidget: What‚Äôs it going to do
[0:28:52] boxofrockets: They will implement unity 2021 once unity 2026 is out
[0:28:57] ReverseRoll: its a daft stance BUT not wiping would be better to make sure its not affecting stuff. (untiy update)
[0:29:02] SFMoe: if you take the average of past wipes the earliest is 10 ish days ffrom now LUL
[0:29:19] xSittinherex: Looking forward to the wipe. I wish bad scavs got more of a penalty and receive more karma for killing the bad scav on your good scav
[0:29:20] tacti_kat: Unity 2021 will raise the floor for QoL upgrades
[0:29:32] krythic_: Hey jesse, how many chickens do you think it would take to overpower and kill an elephant?
[0:29:33] derized: There was some graphic systems and networking things implemented in 2021 I believe

[0:31:19] xSittinherex: Tough raid
[0:31:21] tiz_remz: what happened with the ''wipe account'' games with vel ?
[0:31:22] grumpypantsttv: I‚Äôm level 35 now and this is my first wipe ever playing tarkov, I‚Äôve been to Lighthouse like 10 times in total and 7/10 times I have died to land mines or bosses.
[0:31:23] Real_Slim_Shady7: first extraction of the day, a win in my books
[0:31:25] XXShadowdustXX: fucking hate that some of the spawn locations in this game are just "ok you lose now reset or die"
[0:31:32] feelsbreezy: @JesseKazam hows it goin cutie?
[0:31:41] hk9987: @JesseKazam you know if the region lock is still active?
[0:31:45] ReverseRoll: what does "run through" mean? Kappa
[0:31:53] ReverseRoll: does that mea it was an epic raid?
[0:32:08] xSittinherex: @reverseroll face rolled the raid
[0:32:10] SFMoe: @hk9987 i play with european friends all the time
[0:32:17] hk9987: so i could log into a account from a buddy from the states and help him out with some quests?
[0:32:27] Gunwaltz: Run through only playthrough jesse lol
[0:32:31] xSittinherex: Bosses ram from you, rogues laid down. Loot just came to you
[0:32:41] stunpymidget: I hope they reduce the server selection and increase ping
[0:32:48] tiz_remz: @JesseKazam any way to know who gave me sub if i missed it ?
[0:32:53] xSittinherex: @hk9987 yes
[0:32:53] Zilinity: Ultra chad run guys. Poggers. Raid survival % major increase. Mega chad strats
[0:32:56] ReverseRoll: NA accounts only work NA. EU accounts work worldwide
[0:33:03] ReverseRoll: RUS accounts only work in russia
[0:33:12] Jehs: !playlist

[0:33:30] hk9987: well so id have to work around with VPN its his first wipe so PVP tasks are pretty tough for him xD
[0:33:44] tiz_remz: @SFMoe gg m8
[0:33:45] xSittinherex: Anyone have experience with software stream decks?
[0:33:48] Zilinity: Wait so. Why is account sharing against TOS? What if I got a little bro or friend who wants to know how tarkov is without him buying the game
[0:33:55] Gillieshooter: dont care how?
[0:33:59] SFMoe: just in time for wipe @JesseKazam Kappa
[0:34:01] TheChungusHumongous: That custom PC looks AMAZING btw
[0:34:06] ReverseRoll: @SFMoe i click my profile pick and the sub bit is there. i always forget the addy LUL
[0:34:10] SailYourFace: Upgrading my pc to play star citizen and still get 30 fps in the cities hurts my soul @JesseKazam
[0:34:26] Zilinity: One extra day to make it perfect jesse. That‚Äôs all it is. Cuz they know what happens when Jesse angry
[0:34:26] Gillieshooter: not much, how's humpday treating the pizzaman?
[0:34:27] PAULY_HiROLLER: You're a bleeding nut, Wonka!
[0:34:42] gdur29: bro this pizza PC thing is FUCKIN sick
[0:34:52] XXShadowdustXX: didnt first kappa this wipe do that
[0:34:55] ReverseRoll: like "gold farmers" in runescape
[0:35:03] xSittinherex: But really, what is wrong with account sharing
[0:35:06] Gunwaltz: I've got a monitor a new processor and ram sticks and a star citizen package for my birthday tomorrow couldn't come sooner
[0:35:22] PAULY_HiROLLER: 2thy is Trey's basement rat
[0:35:22] a_nonnys_moose: People used to do that in WoW
[0:35:23] Zilinity: Ahhhhhh. Hey Yk. It‚Äôs a gray area question.
[0:35:38] xSittinherex: In terms of friends help a friend out
[0:35:39] Wigglerr: Password sharing sums it up more. Its knowing other passwords that is really against ToS
[0:35:43] DyeHarD3: LOL
[0:35:57] VicTheWeed: VicTheWeed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Hello Jesse! I'm back from Paris. I saw Vitality win the last CS:GO Major on home soil it was soooooo lit!
[0:35:59] DyeHarD3: #RNG map
[0:36:01] yeelon: i mean what could happen
[0:36:06] xSittinherex: My password is easy: pizzatime0500
[0:36:07] YoungRio: I know your password we get into a fight I wipe your account how‚Äôs that sound
[0:36:23] Zilinity: Ik you can game share on PlayStation. Did that with one of my homies until he tried stealing my account. I ended up getting him perma banned for doing that
[0:36:27] StonerBryan: StonerBryan subscribed with Prime. 
[0:36:36] SFMoe: reset? again? Kappa

[0:37:08] TheChungusHumongous: I've playing to much Zelda, I go back to tarkov right now I'm gonna take a flying leap off a cliff thinking I can glide, only to break every bone in my body.
[0:37:14] Zilinity: Probably. Airwing probably already waiting for you
[0:37:16] ItalianSnipah: Hi Jessie, good evening from Italy, thank you for the pizza
[0:37:18] xSittinherex: @jessekazam what scope is that again?
[0:37:26] YoungRio: You‚Äôll probably get banned for raging your buddies account
[0:37:53] xSittinherex: @jessekazam thx buddy
[0:37:57] DyeHarD3: @JesseKazam is your char Wearing NVGs? Your shadow looks like you are
[0:37:59] Zilinity: @thechungushumongous how I felt when playing destiny then going back to tarkov üòÇ
[0:38:03] captainflanders: @JesseKazam Made an epic account but then forgot what the email and password was, The email expired after not being used forever, so i remade the email and was able to get back in Pog
[0:38:04] TheChungusHumongous: KEKW
[0:38:26] k4ufi: PIZZAMAN!
[0:38:26] TheChungusHumongous: @Zilinity No double jumps here, only pain
[0:38:43] Zilinity: So what are the basic specs of your new pc Jesse? Unless there‚Äôs a command for that
[0:38:49] Zilinity: @thechungushumongous facts

[0:39:18] sir_kingzworth: good afternoon
[0:39:20] ReverseRoll: @TheChungusHumongous i mess about and do "hero jumps" in apex. it fs dont work in tark KEKW
[0:39:46] StonerBryan: you playing solo today?
[0:40:01] SFMoe: @ReverseRoll i can attest to that.. i once jumped over a railing in tarkov and lost... that rarely happens in COD Kappa
[0:40:04] TheChungusHumongous: OMEGALUL @ReverseRoll Yep, going airborne in this game is a death sentence more than anything.
[0:40:10] Zilinity: You‚Äôre already gonna be wet at a water park. Was in a wave pool during a thunderstorm at disneyworld. Nearly died low key
[0:40:39] TheChungusHumongous: Well he's gotcha there
[0:41:02] ItalianSnipah: expecialy the 2 years odl
[0:41:04] YoungRio: Dealing with sick kids isn‚Äôt fun
[0:41:11] TheChungusHumongous: Every park is a water park when it's raining weSmart
[0:41:18] jpacific27: morning jesse
[0:41:30] Big_Pappi069: @TheChungusHumongous Big Brain moves
[0:41:36] TheChungusHumongous: NODDERS
[0:41:44] sassquatch_420: I still can't for the life of me figure out how to have consistently good raids on lighthouse
[0:41:55] sir_kingzworth: sir_kingzworth converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:41:56] Zilinity: Oh ya. Gotta keep an eye on them too at parks. They will be holding your hand 1 second and be talking to Woody that‚Äôs 100 yds away from you the next
[0:42:00] Gunwaltz: @sassquatch_420 pray and run for your life
[0:42:10] sassquatch_420: so the Tarkov strat?
[0:42:11] Zilinity: ^and that was me with my parents Kappa
[0:42:24] sir_kingzworth: kazamPizzaSpin kazamPizzaSpin kazamPizzaSpin
[0:42:29] xSittinherex: Anyone else use the tac30 scope
[0:42:44] sassquatch_420: It's just how fucking hard they lock down the other side of the river
[0:42:48] inmypajamas310: inmypajamas310 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[0:42:50] sassquatch_420: Especially with the bots
[0:42:50] Silentwarrior_600: You farming zrt
[0:42:52] tacti_kat: They haven't mentioned it, I can imagine why but I hope that BSG has more planned for Lightkeeper
[0:42:53] Silentwarrior_600: Zry?
[0:43:24] XXShadowdustXX: its not the same game

[0:43:34] TheChungusHumongous: Everyone is there for a reason early wipe NODDERS
[0:44:11] Zilinity: Are people more ‚Äútoxic‚Äù early wipe compared to late wipe or vice versa. Cause I‚Äôd be the friendly PMC when it comes to locked rooms or needed keys for a task early wipe
[0:44:28] sassquatch_420: @Zilinity Neither, it all boils down to the person. Some are nice, some aren't
[0:44:37] hk9987: find shit
[0:44:39] XXShadowdustXX: hand in item
[0:45:18] TheChungusHumongous: Jager has an Uber Eats order, deliver it to him on woods NODDERS
[0:45:19] snizzgames: mark these 3 spots 3 separate times on shoreline.. so dumb
[0:45:21] Wigglerr: Almost every early game task should be like a daily or randomly generated tasks on the start of each raid specific to the raid
[0:45:29] SFMoe: i like the plant one cause it forces players to a location x amount of times
[0:45:39] PAULY_HiROLLER: Diversify
[0:45:40] DryEyeAyes: I like that idea. ^^ Finished 2/3 of Chumming recently, and I love-hated the way it made me change up my secure container.
[0:45:42] Nightbot: Get 20% OFF + Free International Shipping @Manscaped with promo code "KAZAM" at https://manscaped.com/jessekazam
[0:45:59] Zilinity: Hand in, go to location, extract from this location, plant this, kill this many times,
[0:46:02] hk9987: how about conflicting task objectives?
[0:46:18] xSittinherex: Should get rid of fixing the circuit boards in factory.
[0:46:30] Zilinity: I remember getting a weekly where I had to kill killa 10 times or something like that. And I‚Äôm like. Nah. Cause the award was dog water
[0:46:33] TheChungusHumongous: Or maybe some plant quests that require you to find a type of item in that raid, like tools or food etc? @JesseKazam
[0:46:35] hk9987: you are here to defend and the other needs to kill
[0:46:53] tacti_kat: I'd like to see more nuanced tasks for level 45 and up PMC's like "Survive on this map without armor, and bring this item to this location for a dead drop"
[0:47:09] OldCdnGamer: @JesseKazam don't you find after the amount of time you spent in this game.  Wouldn't you like to have a fresh number of task to keep the interest?
[0:47:13] CrazyOldMaurice99: That would be actually pretty dope
[0:47:27] Nightbot:  If you are enjoying the stream make sure to hit the follow button and click the bell to know when I go live!
[0:47:34] H3LPS1DE: Thats my idea for dailys or weeklys. Conflicting tasks that lead you to each other
[0:47:37] Gewdo: How much would that complicate server Q times?
[0:47:39] xSittinherex: How about player generated quest
[0:47:47] mestaryman: Yo what‚Äôs up Jesse!
[0:47:59] HEMIN6WAY: do mini events, where 1000 usec need to plant before 1000 bears plan in the same area
[0:48:13] ReverseRoll: @Gewdo imagine they just did an event to test easily allocating servers to maps ;)
[0:48:17] SFMoe: it would be nice if you also got a reward for the percentage of a weekly / daily you got
[0:48:24] sassquatch_420: Or just have event type quests that force people to one spot. Like everyone has a quest to both plant and steal markers on each map
[0:48:40] Gewdo: I like it a lot.
[0:48:43] TheChungusHumongous: I like that NODDERS
[0:48:44] Wigglerr: Those tasks should be given out at the start of each raid to the PMCs in the raid
[0:48:44] Gunwaltz: Would be fun if they did an event that made usec team up and bears team up to do stuff
[0:48:45] sassquatch_420: Prapor tells you to steal 3 markers on lighthouse, peacekeeper wants 3 planted
[0:49:15] kneehigh80: Yooo @jessekazam and chat
[0:49:24] sassquatch_420: yoooooo
[0:49:27] sassquatch_420: that would be tight
[0:49:30] 1MMORTELLEAGUE: did you get your new pc ?
[0:49:34] hk9987: bounty hunting?
[0:49:41] DryEyeAyes: o.o Sounds like the Scav Box, but with extra steps!
[0:49:44] Zilinity: That would be dope.
[0:49:44] TylerOddity: that would be interesting
[0:49:49] potzndpanz: @Jessekazam !!  Its time to cook!
[0:50:00] Zilinity: @jessekazam I‚Äôd mess with you and airwing so badly if that was a thing Kappa
[0:50:01] HereticJ: Miiiiilitary cofdmmmmmmm
[0:50:07] bigballmagoo: or pmcs could post "jobs" for other pmcs
[0:50:17] DryEyeAyes: Oh shoot, when did I get gifted a sub?! Gotta write somebody a thank-you whisper.
[0:50:20] ReverseRoll: its a scav case but with choices LUL
[0:50:24] TheChungusHumongous: That would be cool but it would get out of hand, like it would have to be absurdly priced or maybe limited use/cost rep etc
[0:50:25] mestaryman: When do you get the new PC?
[0:50:28] SFMoe: yeah but add the rng of the posiblity of a timmy getting that quest LUL
[0:50:30] Gunwaltz: Would be cool if you could hire players to do shit for you
[0:50:45] TheChungusHumongous: Sounds like RMT Kappa
[0:50:47] Chamagoiaba: I always though there should be a way to "launder" and turn an item find in raid through Fence
[0:50:56] hk9987: like we do already
[0:50:57] ReverseRoll: if they tk they lose a load of rep LUL
[0:50:58] atropine_: i need that i have been hammered all day
[0:51:04] hk9987: at least if you help timmys xD
[0:51:04] potzndpanz: I've been watching ur shorts and vods, so I decided to come here today
[0:51:23] XXShadowdustXX: i never understood how traders are supposed to be able to tell the difference between FIR and non-FIR
[0:51:25] tacti_kat: What about tasks that offer more than 1 way to complete it, with a "easy" completion and a "hard" completion requirement but with more XP or better rewards. Like "Kill 3 PMC'S on woods" or Extract with 1 PMC who you didn't queue up with" like basically asking you to try and cooperate with a random @jessekazam
[0:51:36] Zilinity: Hire for protection or like @bigballmagoo said being able to post jobs. to help you find items or something
[0:51:41] thin_red_line9582: Pay other pmcs to sherpa you for a task, caveat you become marked
[0:51:45] XXShadowdustXX: and they'll be like "get me this item but it cant be tamptered with so you'll have to TAKE IT OFF THE DEAD BODY OF A SCAV"
[0:51:56] P0tat0A1m777: Ill pay, but delivery from past gives like 20k lol
[0:51:58] H3LPS1DE: More quests like peacekeeper thats obvious what youre doing?
[0:52:06] H3LPS1DE: could help with that idea
[0:52:18] hk9987: @JesseKazam better ring up apple the gold is flowing here for BSG lmao
[0:52:28] shmooexe: it would be really cool if you had like a 1 %chance as spawing in as a scav boss on your scav player
[0:52:30] HyramMTG: Didnt Veritas have this exact idea on the Pogcast?
[0:52:43] Gunwaltz: Spawning in as killa would be hilarious
[0:52:56] theDartrunner: PepegaPhone
[0:53:08] TheChungusHumongous: COPIUM
[0:53:15] Chamagoiaba: 'Kill x within time' quest idea gave me Punisher ptsd flashbacks
[0:53:20] H3LPS1DE: I wouldnt even want that as a scav id want to be able to be the insurance scav lol going in and getting other players loot
[0:53:22] shmooexe: that would be sick though like lets face it who wouldnt want to run around as tagila or killa
[0:53:26] k4ufi: Tbh spawning as a player as killa would be a downgrade of Killa :D
[0:53:27] DryEyeAyes: Sanitar's health with an actual brain behind it could be terrifying.
[0:53:35] Zilinity: You have 1 month to turn in a Found in Raid LedX from Woods/Lighthouse for 500K roubles and some character XP
[0:53:40] theDartrunner: did two interviews and a tour with a company, had to call them for them to tell me they went with someone else. PepeHands
[0:53:42] kneehigh80: Can I make. Suggestion regarding your discord ? Since there are sooo many amazing people who help newer players with advice or carry people show them loot give them gear, we should kinda reward these amazing community members !!!!
[0:53:57] H3LPS1DE: IVE BEEN BRAINSTORMING THIS FOR WEEKS BRO
[0:54:11] Pekicro: will they remove tarkov shooter part 8?
[0:54:18] zorpthug: or you return the loot to Prapor
[0:54:19] Nightbot:  You can subscribe FOR FREE with Twitch Prime and AVOID all ads on the channel! Click the "Subscribe" button at the top of the stream and click the option to subscribe with Prime!
[0:54:23] notanothernathan: oh my, that sounds fun AF
[0:54:33] Zilinity: That would be dope
[0:54:43] k4ufi: Or scav missions could be getting the insured loot of players for a reward from Therapist/parpor? :D
[0:54:46] ASHRISES: That would be a great Lore based mechanic
[0:54:46] Real_Slim_Shady7: damn there are some great minds in this chat @JesseKazam
[0:54:48] Br41N1987: So the player would get their loot back through insurance still?
[0:54:48] potzndpanz: Milk!
[0:54:48] Chamagoiaba: Then the money sink dies, it's the opposite of a money sink
[0:54:48] SFMoe: ooo like i want this mp7 but fence will give you more than the resale value of it hmmmm
[0:54:59] Real_Slim_Shady7: BSG needs to employ these chatter lmfao
[0:55:06] BladeZero__: That would be a lot of fun actually. Like They could do it where you're put into a raid that's "ended" and you're given a certain amount of time to walk around and look for dead PMCs and their gear
[0:55:12] its_ezlan: @JesseKazam also he could  have some random high tier FIR Barter items that would match the price
[0:55:40] DryEyeAyes: This is the kind of backseat development I like. Not complaining about balance, but a lil' imaginative tinkering with what we already have.
[0:55:44] ItalianSnipah: I made up a storyline to actually escape from tarkov, like if it was real
[0:56:08] H3LPS1DE: Would have to lock it behind high scav karma lol
[0:56:13] tacti_kat: With that system as a solo player I'd basically never insure my stuff
[0:56:23] Real_Slim_Shady7: there you go with your streamer opinion LUL LUL LUL @JesseKazam
[0:56:25] Mad_FireTV: I would love to see PMCs come together to take over maps and loot every scrap and everyone vibe and get out. Obviously not all the time but at times would be dope.
[0:56:40] xSittinherex: How about a quest board that has easy, medium, hard, epic. Each tier has more xp/rubbles, among other items.  Quest range from daily, weekly, monthly and maybe quarterly (?). Players can pick 3 dailies, 1 weekly etc
[0:57:01] Zilinity: Or if a scav found it. And turned it into fence. Fence sends a message to that player for a random. Like ‚Äúhey a scav found your gear. If you want it back, you must pay X amount of money and trade X items for it back. You have X time to complete it‚Äù
[0:57:13] ItalianSnipah: can I share mine for a real tarkov challenge?
[0:57:20] H3LPS1DE: Just anything different than the usual interactions lol
[0:57:34] AgentFox94: They are going to have to implement something like the working together Daily if we ever actually get PMC karma
[0:57:37] ReverseRoll: "little black book" is a task to "collect 10 pmc's names by greeting them"
[0:57:50] xSittinherex: @zilinity or make you do  a quest for him
[0:57:59] notanothernathan: trade x with other scavs
[0:58:02] icecream_k3lly: is the night vision scope worth something now?
[0:58:20] Nightbot: Make sure to follow Jesse on Twitter https://bit.ly/2UCfzPA
