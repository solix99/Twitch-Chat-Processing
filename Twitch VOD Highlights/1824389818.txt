[0:45:13] jamminjammies: charlie is so funny
[0:45:17] ShaldowB: I don't  thi k you realise how many of miz's streams come from asking his offline chat or alt what to do the night before

[0:45:32] alexdegar: Numbers are j7st numbers dawg its about being a 20K Andy in your heart
[0:45:39] Boomboombloom: to be fair it took will 2 shitcamps and 2 shows with austin to get to 5/6k consistently @wakewilder keep cumstacking and you'll continue growing
[0:45:47] XxSantos_ProxX: ZAMN cock cam
[0:45:48] fuyafl: both moist and asmon are huge due to how long they have been streaming growing your channel like them takes times

[0:46:41] johnnyi215: Will only got big from collabing....he hovered at like 1-2K even with Hasan raiding into him every night
[0:46:52] twinklesparkles: stop yearning and go live in the woods. then write a manifesto. @wakewilder
[0:46:55] break_the_bone: You have the ideas. Believe in yourself and take the action
[0:46:56] 1daer: @wakewilder if you somehow convince asmon to go to the gym with you on his stream or yours its a banger
[0:47:05] artekia321: as long as you keep giving my mom the attention she deserves
[0:47:07] 8promethean8: You gotta ask for primes more too
[0:47:13] ShihabOnSight: Wake, I’m tired can you rub my back
[0:47:16] GrannBrigitte: if you guys need a thotty fitness streamer who is as knowledgeable as wake and is also a former wow addict there's another very new partner called holderhek and he actually likes fitness as a platform. he is normally live weekdays around 11
[0:47:25] IamChillson: When we dressing you up as Batman and playing hide and seek with Emi, Simply, and Russell?
[0:47:25] fluffytummmy: i'll come wake Gachi

[0:47:31] swoLaRX: ill CUM on your stream
[0:47:33] alexdegar: It works for mizkif
[0:47:34] johnsondonpiano: Collab Wake, Cyr is doing stream with Peachjars and Jessica completely no content just making pseudo "Pizza" Collabs never gonna get old It's streamers weekly Bread and Butter

[0:47:49] break_the_bone: You should 100% be more comfortable asking for subs/donos too imo. Gray calls it 'the 5 sub community challenge'
[0:47:56] Sebbaru_: hello timing made me click in
[0:47:58] artekia321: @johnsondonpiano cyr IS content
[0:48:00] fapplegg: grats wake
[0:48:03] 1ndomitabl3: @wakewilder THATS HOW U GROW U MUST INTETRACT WITH STREAMERS AND JUST TELL THEM SO WHAT
[0:48:06] iAM_Duckyyy: that backpack when you get it is gonna make you shine even more
[0:48:08] iAM_Duckyyy: dw
[0:48:10] swoLaRX: ask chat why they click
[0:48:24] break_the_bone: hello mail
[0:48:27] ShaldowB: I think a good bit would be you doing a stream with peach where you teach her how to be a partner-level streamer and just give her really shit advice
[0:48:37] Gaudrix: people watch Asmon react more than anything else. He has built that over like a decade of consistency.
[0:48:39] fluffytummmy: good idea
[0:48:40] fuyafl: what i have noticed is that your viewers go up quite a bit as you stream for more hours i feel you have really good viewer retention...
[0:48:46] SideShowKeith: the thing is there is no easy way  to do this shit. if you go digging into big streamers' past you'll realize that they've done everything to get where they are at rn
[0:48:54] Kangaroo_Balls: Would love to see you do one day a week IRL

[0:49:49] nSayneTV: the only thing is bounty's
[0:49:50] PERIL: I can't forget you anymore. Congrats.
[0:49:51] jamminjammies: i thought you got ad money
[0:49:52] swoLaRX: i go in and out of every stream depending on current content
[0:49:53] Gaudrix: That's how it is. You build a consistent viewership piece by piece. If the content is consistent then so will the viewership.
[0:49:54] mrbrownstone1482: are the ad bounties partner only?
[0:49:58] break_the_bone: Yeah, but now people will see you when you type in their chat KEKW

[0:50:02] nSayneTV: @mrbrownstone1482 YES

[0:50:06] SideShowKeith: watch and weep
[0:50:07] zenyatta: hasHmm
[0:50:21] swoLaRX: 9 minutes an hour is insane
[0:50:25] nSayneTV: Bounties though and people dont mind them

[0:57:18] MisterParry: You shoot the shit and discuss what's going on in the streaming world. You're OTK adjacent and have an unique vantage point to give chat the feeling of being 'behind the scenes'

[0:59:18] ElderFr0g: I have a secret schizo conspiracy that your streaming niche is constantly talking with chat about how you don't know what your content niche to be is. It's all one big meta play.

[2:05:14] ledmap: Ego is my neighbour
[2:05:16] 1ndomitabl3: even google thinks so.,Everyone has an ego. There are many definitions of the ego, but to put it simply, it's your sense of personal identity or feelings of self-importance. It helps you to identify your 'uniqueness', to stand up for yourself and to put plans into action.

[2:06:18] 1ndomitabl3: @wakewilder It is our ego that breeds our self-confidence, our drive for success and our optimism. All champions have a big ego. Without a big ego they would never have reached their fullest potential and become champions.

[2:24:36] ZMoney19K: watch the behind the scenes of that jump
[2:24:37] Dvicious012: classic Train fight
[2:24:39] mrbrownstone1482: also Rebecca Ferguson is so fucking hot
[2:24:45] mootie1: Ultimate objective: CUM
[2:24:47] clintstu: Top Gun was insanely good
[2:24:47] hrafnagut: middle tooth middle tooth
[2:24:47] Fi3ndi5h: I never thought Id type this....but Tom Cruise is a bad ass
[2:24:48] threinen: damn shame he's a scientologist
[2:24:48] 1ndomitabl3: climbing treacherous Cliff faces scaling the tallest buildings jumping over huge gaps and from super high altitudes acrobatics in the air and underwater. and now riding a motorbike down a monster ski jump and skydiving to safety Tom Cruise is known for doing all his own stunts.
[2:24:48] essarrbee: Another train top fight. That's a callback the first movie
[2:24:50] Dogemaster11: @sarcasticenchilada and Tom Cruise intends to go to literal space to film a movie
[2:24:53] taxeeevasion: Him doing his own stunts makes these movies even better
[2:24:57] Benjammar: Tom cruise actually jumped off that cliff. I saw a behind the scenes on it was cool
[2:24:58] KHOHX: M:I is tongue-in-cheek but every production is so solid

[2:25:05] IZzwizZY: Die tryong type shit
[2:25:07] NorthKhalea: yeah he seems super interested in the technical aspects
[2:25:14] iAM_Duckyyy: not every movie needs to be super well written imo, sometimes i just wanna go watch a movie and turn my brain off and watch crazy stuff
[2:25:15] JonDuhLion: Its because he is incontact with Xenu obviously
[2:25:19] Fi3ndi5h: Well....Quentin Tarentino deserves that praise as well

[2:26:06] IZzwizZY: He will hear about this
[2:26:08] sarcasticenchilada: Tom Cruise reminds me of Patrick Bateman, his vibes are off to me
[2:26:09] MisterParry: Bruce Willis sold his likeness to be deepfaked into movies. When do you think we'll see the new Die Hard?
[2:26:11] Dvicious012: There's some morbid fact that if Tom Cruise ever died during a shoot the studio would make more from his Insurance Policy than the movie profits
[2:26:16] Dogemaster11: No one gives a fuck bout the Scientology shit tho
[2:26:25] iAM_Duckyyy: south park told me hes trapped in the closet
[2:26:36] ExArthure: word is hes the only one who is "pure clear"
[2:26:43] HEPHAESTUStwo: YEP
[2:26:47] Fi3ndi5h: he might as well be a co-author of Dianetics LULW
[2:26:49] threinen: monkaS
[2:26:52] WickedMoney17: More money you kick in the higher you go in Scientology
[2:26:52] StartSimulation: lol some guy in a suit in every movie tells tom cruise that this mission will cost him dearly
[2:26:53] thomastgoldsmith: LUL so on point
[2:26:56] ExArthure: like he got more clear then the dear leader
[2:27:07] IZzwizZY: Nothing behined the eyes

You are a shut-in self-hating white man twisted by delusions of mythical Japanese superiority and exposure to Japanese media into a disgusting mockery of nature’s perfection. All 'validation' you get from other people in this position couldn't be worse in making you believe that spending years of your life learning a globally useless language to a first-grader's leve

Yes, I get that it's awkward because of things like Pearl Harbor, but I don't hold it against them. They weren't in Unit 731,

[4:46:21] CeIoron: Kai is a good streamer tbh
[4:46:22] jeremy3186: I'm too old to enjoy someone screaming at me for 5 hours and thinking its "funny" somehow
[4:46:22] NEET_In_Progress: oh the Speed racist thing
[4:46:26] IZzwizZY: We the people
[4:46:27] InconCLEAVEable: we all are
[4:46:28] UTSAJennifer: Yeah I don’t watch Speed
[4:46:32] brewke: i worry about twitch. anyone who tries to jump in new will have a hard time understanding anything with all the emote extensions, huge barrier to entry
[4:46:37] CeIoron: I feel weird watching him tho as a boomer twitch user
[4:46:41] historyfact: yea
[4:46:41] CeIoron: but kai is really good
[4:46:44] MisterParry: The Gerudo are racist af

[4:47:09] historyfact: kai has done some stuff too but not him saying it
[4:47:15] Fi3ndi5h: neither are as bad as bruce
[4:47:17] jozef_the_grey: Kai is magnetic to watch, even I as an old fuck can tell. not my thing but still.
[4:47:17] ElRoliss69: I would consider watching Kai if he didnt blow up my eardrums everytime I went to his stream. With tectone at least the loud is constant. With Kai its explosive and intermittent
[4:47:23] prettythiccwbu: https://youtu.be/skUgegwkX9I this is what i find funny @wakewilder
[4:47:25] historyfact: guest's say stuff like that
[4:47:28] JauntyTV: ya that makes sense
[4:47:30] oooutbreak: not gonna change if its making you a millionaire at 20

[4:57:31] Fi3ndi5h: Sorry, but you just used the word Milieue that I dont think alot of viewers will understand.

[4:57:39] alvy8bit: i think "being loud" can be a tool for comedy (like a punchline) but if everything somebody does is screaming thats not my cup of tea
[4:57:39] maaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: Chris Farley could be deemed as “loud”
[4:57:42] Fi3ndi5h: *not
[4:57:47] meaty_chud: There are streamers who's voice never goes below 20 decibals even when just talking. That is loud=funny
[4:57:49] brewke: we have internalized prejudices/behaviors that we have to actually be interested in uncovering to realize they're there. so some people will never understand that
[4:57:51] SDbrewer23: YEP

[4:58:13] danteimmortal: @brewke So true dude
[4:58:21] ArashTheViewer: is loud = funny racial? ive never used it in that manner
[4:58:21] thomastgoldsmith: Kai does just seem to yell none stopped
[4:58:24] zenyatta: at this point whenever someone mentions loudness whenever a W streamer is clipped, it may as well be a dog whistle
[4:58:28] BinchMcSwerve: i dont know about it being racist. the dude is jsut loud

[4:58:33] GormenGhaster: @jeremy3186 its not even xenophobia, they just aren't around the language all the time. the legal language is not english in 95% of EU countries
[4:58:36] JauntyTV: nice one dono
[4:58:40] SuperCarEnjoyer: @yeahright_yeahright the point is not that he's unfunny, it's that they're characterizing him on a false premise, that him being loud is the appeal
[4:58:41] snabobo: good one KEKW
[4:58:51] UTSAJennifer: @thomastgoldsmith I have honestly never seen Kai yelled
[4:58:53] jeremy3186: @GormenGhaster "legal" language? lol
[4:58:58] T_mac87: @heinousanus95 saying the nword depends on the context
[4:58:59] tristalien: rip bank account dono
[4:59:02] MisterParry: Kai does seem to be yelling every time I click on his stream. He's funny, but he also yells more often than most.
[4:59:03] ShaldowB: reductive
[4:59:20] GormenGhaster: @jeremy3186 yes, languages on signs and official documents
[4:59:21] prettythiccwbu: i like xqc always have been following him since 2018 but hes not that 6 consoles guy anymore
[4:59:21] isJill: yep
[4:59:23] NEET_In_Progress: i think people have been saying loud = funny long before Kia was popular, idk if its just a race thing
[4:59:24] BinchMcSwerve: i havent seen it said about anyone but these streamers
[4:59:32] StreamElements: SUBSCRIBE ON YOUTUBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJH-yCXrZJU5_fYArygfMw
[4:59:33] zenyatta: also kai is from NYC and that's just our indoor voice tbh moon2S
[4:59:39] yeahright_yeahright: @supercarenjoyer why are they as content creators being reduced to whether they're funny or not though?
[4:59:40] solferin: isn't that more of a jab at the audience rather than a streamer himself?
[4:59:42] CeIoron: I saw that phrase so long before black content creators really rose to the top like they have in recent years (which I am glad they get the representation)
[4:59:45] brewke: the willingness to be bold/act out of the "norm" when you're young is huge
[4:59:45] historyfact: NO WAY
[4:59:46] jozef_the_grey: true, loud and edgy and borderline racist = funny when I was young
[4:59:52] meaty_chud: The phrase wouldn't exist and be so popular if it wasn't true. And I don't think anyone here said only black people do it. It just got brought up with speed and kai
[4:59:54] historyfact: 0.001%
[4:59:57] javifarms: i hear it in more than just black culture its more a youth thing for sure
[4:59:57] alvy8bit: isnt there a stereotype in the black community that when they find something funny they scream more and cant sit still compared to the rest of the world?
[4:59:58] thomastgoldsmith: Loud = funny did not start with Kai
[5:00:01] KHOHX: but loud = funny was never about the W community? have I missed something? xqc was first?
[5:00:01] TheBongJedi: loud = funny has been a massive part of memes for many years

[5:00:07] dankdaemon: i heard that alot about chris farley
[5:00:18] lush_puppies: as weird as it may sound for some, think of this like music. certain genres in western music sound good to us because we use the western scale. however, to many in America, music in eastern cultures that uses a different musical language wouldn't "get it"
[5:00:20] heinousanus95: @t_mac87 my original point was people who say they feel uncomfortable around the word dont have context for why we use it. I understand context is important.
[5:00:26] mariobp18: KSI has been loud since a decade ago
[5:00:27] jeremy3186: @GormenGhaster so all those signs that have english and the native language? English has become known world wide because of the internet.. but that's not the point.. the point was people are so multi cultural in europe they learned each other's languages
[5:00:30] historyfact: it did not start with race
[5:00:37] demesta1: @Fi3ndi5h it's not..
[5:00:38] meaty_chud: @fi3ndi5h what about ppl like xqc
[5:00:39] zenyatta: @Fi3ndi5h stop bringing it up against young black streamers and excusing it for others then

[5:00:46] GormenGhaster: yeah its like annoying orange. loud gets younger people going
[5:00:53] Gaudrix: Chris Rock's shtick is that he says the same joke over and over just louder each time. He is funny as hell. Sometimes it's just not funny though.
[5:00:53] UTSAJennifer: Some of these comments here about black people are weird- am I the only black personality here lol
[5:00:55] jeremy3186: I think the "loud" thing started with the Paul brothers.. who annoy the hell out me too
[5:00:56] yeahright_yeahright: Its not applied to other people, let's be honest
[5:01:00] MisterParry: They used to say that about Eddie Murphy

[5:01:23] BinchMcSwerve: i ahve literally never heard someone say loud + funny since twitch
[5:01:25] javifarms: @IZzwizZY kat is funny af.
[5:01:27] Fi3ndi5h: @meaty_chud I dont think Xqc is funny,,,,is he loud?
[5:01:32] CeIoron: i guess i havent heard that
[5:01:33] SuperCarEnjoyer: @LucidControl people didn't reduce him to that though, imo
[5:01:38] demesta1: we get into dangerous territory when we start to assume things are just racist without clear evidence..
[5:01:47] MisterParry: Another chatter mentioned Chris Farley, and that's a great example of a white comedian who didn't get labeled like that
[5:01:50] isJill: right
[5:01:51] jeremy3186: I really don't think it's a race thing.. I think its an annoyance thing.. just my 2 cents though
[5:01:55] zenyatta: black people just have to show an emotion and someone in the room will be like ooooh this is intense!
[5:01:56] rickTEXAS777: precisely
[5:02:00] lush_puppies: a lot of those criticisms thrown at black comedians certainly forget to throw it at comedians like Sam Kinison
[5:02:09] GormenGhaster: @jeremy3186 lmao thats a very small minority. you could maybe make that argument in Belgium, but Belgium is a small small percentage of the EU population.
[5:02:10] iAM_Duckyyy: Guys don't forget to pitch ideas for the partner celebration stream! Tell wake what you'd like to see! WakePls
[5:02:17] SDbrewer23: Will Neff can be really loud, but I love him
[5:02:21] Jarnes7: would you snack on your own wiener?
[5:02:33] CeIoron: true
[5:02:37] T_mac87: they over use it, bad writing
[5:02:38] heinousanus95: @lush_puppies kinison gets a pass imo
[5:02:38] BinchMcSwerve: im just lost about where race comes in
[5:02:40] jeremy3186: @GormenGhaster which part? multicultural or signs?
[5:02:41] iAM_Duckyyy: @CeIoron, omg hello hi hello
[5:02:41] soulmateueu: some people find kai funny but i think whats more common is group think
[5:02:43] JauntyTV: @Jarnes7 HUH
[5:02:45] UTSAJennifer: Black people always get labeled as crazy when we raise our voices. It’s wild
[5:02:46] IZzwizZY: It makes sense. Look at Dave
[5:02:46] heinousanus95: Rip
[5:02:47] thomastgoldsmith: Kind of the same thing as saying 12 yo humor
[5:02:47] cheecl4y: Kai's main audience is kids. And the youth are usually the Loud = Funny.
[5:02:48] isJill: right 󠀀
[5:02:55] KHOHX: but if its superloud and not funny ... ?
[5:02:55] CeIoron: if a man screams into a mic its not going to be funny
[5:02:59] yeahright_yeahright: @demesta1 evidence up to whose standards? Dangerous for whom?
[5:03:03] javifarms: makes sense. some people are loud to try to be funny but its about the context of what they are saying
[5:03:09] SDbrewer23: Why bring anyone down? Just let them be
[5:03:12] lush_puppies: @heinousanus95 the point still stands regardless if YOU give him a pass
[5:03:13] UTSAJennifer: @khohx LUL
[5:03:15] NEET_In_Progress: @cheecl4y i think its more that than a race issue
[5:03:16] citruschrome: Still playing wrath?
[5:03:23] mistodoj: fasho loud - funny was only a thing cuz ppl started abusing earrape in memes... now everyone just uses it if your voice is slightly loud or you yell for a sec
[5:03:23] Gaudrix: loudness can increase the degree of something being funny, but it is a fairly easy layup in terms of comedy
[5:03:23] prettythiccwbu: what has colour got to do with shit? if you are funny you are if your not your not all comes down to opinion not race
[5:03:32] lilbuddy__: @wakewilder proud of you
[5:03:33] lush_puppies: they never throw this criticism at Sam Kinison, even if he was a trailblazer. the point still stands
[5:03:35] jozef_the_grey: say something funny, Wake
[5:03:36] heinousanus95: @lush_puppies calm down. It was a joke.
[5:03:40] GormenGhaster: @jeremy3186 multiculturalism and its promotion of a multi-lingual people. thats just fantasy.
[5:03:42] nSayneTV: comedy is a dying art but it still lives if you know it

[5:04:23] DiamondBirch: i think comedy has evolved to adapt to the new mediums available
[5:04:26] yeahright_yeahright: Most people are not funny and way too many people just say whatever and hide behind "its just a prank, bro"
[5:04:27] danteimmortal: The same people who say Eminem was the last great rapper are the people who say comedy is dying lmao
[5:04:28] ShaldowB: comedy isn't dying
[5:04:30] historyfact: yep
[5:04:31] D__Clone: yeah to truly tell that someone is not funny you need to sit in there stream for 3 months and document there lack of humor. /j
[5:04:32] Fi3ndi5h: Someone Just mentioned Sam Kinison....Facts...taht dude was loud and hilarious to me
[5:04:32] StreamElements: TRUTH OR DAB THIS THURSDAY -- ASK AWAY https://forms.gle/chyYmFxVEASiFVjn9
[5:04:33] DJBauer: I get the comedy. For me, it's purely about the audio quality, if they had a limiter and good EQ on their mic, like Doc does when he gets loud, It'd be more enjoyable on the ear.
[5:04:37] KHOHX: u fucking my mom in my mind every 30 minutes is pretty dark FeelsBadMan
[5:04:45] prettythiccwbu: you wont like uk humour then
[5:04:46] notYosh: 0.
[5:04:47] jozef_the_grey: the landscape is changing, its not dying, its adapting. think of Bob Saget, you cant get away with the Aristocrats anymore.
[5:04:49] GormenGhaster: Comedy clubs actually survived the pandemic. Comedy is alive and well.
[5:04:49] oooutbreak: comedy isnt funny anymore Sadge
[5:04:51] CoconutWiggyAus: I think the 'EXTREME' attempts at comedy are completely valid.  Some people just don't enjoy it
[5:04:55] jeremy3186: why is m o m a mom meme? haha
[5:04:56] T_mac87: comedy is being restricted because one person thought it was offensive on social media
[5:04:58] historyfact: was just there
[5:04:59] nazharif: Dark joke is just a phase tbf, i used to love that shit not anymore
[5:05:02] zyne9: i think stand up is declining specifically but no comedy is doing fine
[5:05:02] roadoracle: "comedy is a dying art" - person whose humor is stuck on 2016 idubbbz
[5:05:03] Fi3ndi5h: @lush_puppies Clap
[5:05:08] SuperCarEnjoyer: Kill Tony is an example of dark/edgy comedy that still exists

[5:05:12] hrafnagut: @jeremy3186 cause it's funny

[5:05:18] IZzwizZY: Comedy is getting more limited nowadays
[5:05:19] jeremy3186: @hrafnagut u do that? lol
[5:05:20] notYosh: holy shit i left my house while miz was streaming and twitch hasnt told me theres an error and to refresh
[5:05:33] MisterParry: cow = funny
[5:05:34] Gaudrix: standup is doing well online, I get many snippets on instagram and youtube shorts of new comedians
[5:05:41] schlafhaender: whats an affiliate commencement celebration
[5:05:42] nSayneTV: I dunno maybe that is true, but I love all comedy, but there arnt shows anymore like premium blend that show upcoming comics i miss that stuff @wakewilder thats all I'm saying
[5:05:42] GormenGhaster: i do miss when i watched tv and would watch late night stand-ups. really broadened my horizons
[5:05:43] marq4d: people have been saying "things arent what they used to be" since the dawn of time
[5:05:54] zyne9: i dont get why people like that feel the need to post shit like that
[5:05:55] maaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: Play the clip for context

[5:05:59] Fi3ndi5h: That is a great point @lush_puppies I forgot how much I love Sam kinison
[5:06:02] alvy8bit: you know whats comedy? .. that the "dad" emote in this chat is the missing texture icon dad
[5:06:04] SuperCarEnjoyer: @Gaudrix it's starting to break out of Rogan's walled garden as well. Like Stavros
[5:06:04] yeahright_yeahright: I mean Kai and Speeds communities aren't on reddit and lsf like that
[5:06:04] greaselover1911: reddit comments PepeLaugh
[5:06:07] miIk_dud: lsf Pepepains
[5:06:10] isJill: @marq4d yep
[5:06:19] brewke: you can admit you don't understand, but shitting on those who do is kind of mean
[5:06:19] CoconutWiggyAus: The Iron Man suit last week was fucking cool. I enjoyed it
[5:06:35] IZzwizZY: Adin?
[5:06:40] marq4d: sounds fine to me
[5:06:43] Vercingetorix4: Tectone yell talks just like this
[5:06:44] Majeztic98: how old is that chair
[5:06:50] Fi3ndi5h: I had to turn down
[5:06:51] zyne9: and this is about adin making up egregious shit about kai
[5:06:52] Majeztic98: it got tape on it KEKW
[5:06:53] JauntyTV: MAN IS A MILLIONARE SITTING IN A BUSTED UP CHAIR WHY
[5:06:53] javifarms: yea its about adin
[5:06:53] yeahright_yeahright: Hes not joking here though
[5:06:57] demesta1: hes not even being loud in this clip LUL it gets way worse at times
[5:06:57] prettythiccwbu: why is his teeth glowing like that ross friends episode
[5:06:59] ShaldowB: this is a normal stream
[5:07:04] GeorgiTtv: frfr
[5:07:08] skool_: it is funny they posted a clip of kai talking to his community and then screeching about "wHeRe's ThE cOnTeNt?!?!"
[5:07:09] Gaudrix: Wait this is the clip KEKW wtf
[5:07:13] NEET_In_Progress: a tad LUL
[5:07:16] RadioactiveRandy: do fat burning pills actually work?
[5:07:16] nSayneTV: so true
[5:07:18] GormenGhaster: Kai does a lot of tiktok pandering, but he actually does a lot of interesting stuff in the streaming space He actually DOES things in his room and has great irls
[5:07:19] historyfact: Kappa
[5:07:21] yeahright_yeahright: The carpet stain
[5:07:23] JauntyTV: all of yours are eloquent :)
[5:07:30] jeremy3186: I expected him to get louder and louder as he was dragging that like he did with the "twitch made 10 mill" thing
[5:07:30] MisterParry: Ok, I don't use "cap", but I understood that and everything he said. What zoomer talk was that dude talking about
[5:07:31] jift100: what's this about??
[5:07:32] T_mac87: @Majeztic98 and its not like he doesnt have the money
[5:07:36] 0SAYsan: Loud to be funny is a style. A cadence many comedians incorporate into their skits that work towards the punchline.
[5:07:37] historyfact: i think that was all a sript
[5:07:39] nSayneTV: I dunno maybe that is true, but I love all comedy, but there arnt shows anymore like premium blend that show upcoming comics i miss that stuff @wakewilder thats all I'm saying
[5:07:43] brewke: that was not very loud LUL
[5:07:44] zyne9: he wasn't even loud there
[5:07:49] IZzwizZY: He just didn't know what to say to something that he was cool with
[5:07:49] maaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: It’s tough for him he has to always be careful of what he says
[5:07:55] RadioactiveRandy: hi
[5:07:55] Gaudrix: I don't think he was even trying to be funny
[5:07:59] zenyatta: i talk louder than him when i get heated rofl
[5:08:00] GormenGhaster: in the words of soldier boy ....
[5:08:01] jeremy3186: kai wasn't loud in that clip
[5:08:02] zyne9: holier than thou
[5:08:03] CeIoron: Yeah ive never agreed with loud=funny
[5:08:05] yeahright_yeahright: This is about negotiating deals
[5:08:06] Majeztic98: @Majeztic98 he could 100 chairs sent to him yesterday KEKW
[5:08:07] lush_puppies: @Fi3ndi5h it's easy to overlook, wake makes a great point about prejudice blinding our own perspectives of others and (their) art. funny is funny, and nothing can take away from quality
[5:08:07] RadioactiveRandy: are fat burning pills a scam
[5:08:10] nSayneTV: thats true
[5:08:12] CeIoron: mostly heard it from tectone and lac tho lmao
[5:08:26] BinchMcSwerve: "cant criticize because its racist"
[5:08:30] brewke: people are mad that they have to make an effort to understand evolving language
[5:08:32] historyfact: got 1 guyed?
[5:08:32] javifarms: i had my reservation on kai but watching some of his streams he's very entertaining. gotta give everything a chance
[5:08:32] jift100: that was not that loud
[5:08:35] jeremy3186: @CeIoron they get loud in reaction to content.. they don't get loud just to be loud though
[5:08:45] danteimmortal: It is very ignorant behavior man. Maybe try saying " I am not the targeted audience " instead of shitting on something not made for you
[5:08:51] lush_puppies: you can critique the quality of the work if the joke riding is bad, but using reductive statements like "funny = loud" only highlights their own ignorance and inability to comment on a piece of work
[5:09:03] dankdaemon: bad actors
[5:09:06] historyfact: oh there are a few of those people
[5:09:07] Fi3ndi5h: @lush_puppies True.
[5:09:10] nSayneTV: im with you brother
[5:09:12] prettythiccwbu: everything is racist these days
[5:09:14] jeremy3186: Speed once just started screaming like a maniac and smashed a bunch of PS5's for no apparent reason.. can someone explain to me the comedy in that?
[5:09:15] GormenGhaster: @wakewilder Volume does correlate with underage activity (ie music) but yeah he's actually a great streamer
[5:09:23] maaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: Problem is people like that already made up their mind about Kai a long time ago and will never change it regardless of what he does in the future
[5:09:23] CeIoron: Kai deserves all the success he has and more
[5:09:23] Gaudrix: dicktone is very loud
[5:09:23] JauntyTV: @RadioactiveRandy where is this coming from, and yes the only thing that burns fat is a calorie deficit
[5:09:24] skool_: OMEGALUL 'criticism' = "How can anybody watch this garbage content!!!"
[5:09:32] yeahright_yeahright: "These days"
[5:09:35] prettythiccwbu: true
[5:09:38] NEET_In_Progress: people say the same about XQC though
[5:09:45] lush_puppies: writing*
[5:09:50] MisterParry: racial bias runs deep throughout our culture
[5:09:52] nSayneTV: actually true
[5:09:56] oooutbreak: but xqc rots my brain too
[5:09:58] nickooo22: I hate that the word racist is thrown around so easily. There are actual true racists that think people are beneath them
[5:10:06] brewke: they may not be aware of where the hatred is coming from, but people don't explore these feelings further than just spewing hatred
[5:10:17] zyne9: YEP
[5:10:25] yeahright_yeahright: People really can't handle something not being geared around them or them not being the target audience
[5:10:28] CeIoron: I never knew that until tonight tbh
[5:10:34] IZzwizZY: YEP
[5:10:35] danteimmortal: You can also have prejudices you aren't aware of. It's important to understand that doesn't make you "racist".
[5:10:38] dankdaemon: alternate perspective: some people automatically equate not liking something to the worst possible interpretation
[5:10:43] SDbrewer23: YEP
[5:10:46] D__Clone: a lot of people are racist without the intent of being racist, usually due to ignorance on the topic
[5:10:49] brewke: YEP gotta make the effort to expand
[5:10:49] nSayneTV: damn thats true
[5:10:50] VrtniPatuljak: Asians: math is easy, Europe: math is hard. Americans: is math racist??
[5:10:50] jeremy3186: @nickooo22 to be fair.. inherit bias is built into society... IE we may not be racist, but we may have been trained to see people differently without realizing it
[5:10:53] luscious_gandhi: w take
[5:11:03] snabobo: rad, tubular
[5:11:06] historyfact: no i dislike kai from racist idea's him and his friends talk about many times has nothing to do with funny or loud
[5:11:13] Fi3ndi5h: Who said that Clap
[5:11:17] MisterParry: Everyone is entitled to their opinion, unless they disagree with me because then they're wrong
[5:11:19] zenyatta: @danteimmortal some things are obviously being said as dogwhistles nowadays and i feel like loud=funny has become one
[5:11:20] CeIoron: Some of my irl friends think all right leaning people are racist
[5:11:21] historyfact: yep
[5:11:30] isJill: hanyaSipTea
[5:11:31] thomastgoldsmith: idk i'm not sure it's that deep it's like when someone doesn't like a flavor they say "this taste like sewer water "
[5:11:34] jeremy3186: @VrtniPatuljak the governor of florida banned over 70 math books because he said they were too ethnic... I chit you not
[5:11:37] ANaturalZero: brop i lopve you wake
[5:11:40] historyfact: there was one with a rapper
[5:11:46] ANaturalZero: sorry keyboard to sensitive
[5:11:46] historyfact: searching
[5:11:47] ExArthure: I 100% agree with you. That being said I don’t really like when streamers scream. But that goes for any streamer. But that’s just my preference.
[5:12:04] InconCLEAVEable: Sewer people lives matter wake! how dare you
[5:12:08] VrtniPatuljak: @jeremy3186 good luck future engineers LUL
[5:12:12] danteimmortal: @danteimmortal Oh absolutely. The issue is I don't think many people are self aware enough to even know how much they are showing their own prejudice. Then Ego takes over if they get called out so they double down instead of trying to improve their own understanding
[5:12:12] nickooo22: I personally have seen a true racist. He legitimately treated the people lesser than him. But now not liking a certain music can be racist. It's ridiculous
[5:12:20] SmileSprite: Is there any scientic study that after accounting for social factors show no difference?
[5:12:21] maaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: Any gilfs in the chat
[5:12:23] CoconutWiggyAus: Kai has a Chris Tucker vibe about him. I think it's hilarious
[5:12:30] thomastgoldsmith: people say that about tiktok, video game television
[5:12:31] T_mac87: a european saying an american joke to make fun of americans
[5:12:31] nSayneTV: true
[5:12:33] jeremy3186: @VrtniPatuljak he did it for fascist "anti woke" propaganda
[5:12:37] CeIoron: My grandparents are straight up racist Sadge
[5:12:39] D__Clone: racism is a scale
[5:12:39] MisterParry: If I don't like something I don't shit on it, I just watch something else.
[5:12:40] nickooo22: True
[5:12:44] luscious_gandhi: racism isn't just out right saying slurs
[5:12:46] cuttyriver420: zugzug2Sip
[5:12:46] oooutbreak: but its not the race thats being implied as "making you dumber," its the content?
[5:12:54] ExArthure: Like I love Teccy. But when he starts screaming I have to turn it down and the. Turn it back up to hear him and that annoys me.
[5:12:57] CeIoron: Idk how to talk to my family about this sort of stuff
[5:13:00] IZzwizZY: If it burns, it hurts
[5:13:04] brewke: YEP
[5:13:10] isJill: NODDERS
[5:13:18] danteimmortal: @MisterParry This is the way. It's so damn simple.
[5:13:18] isJill: Hmm
[5:13:21] nickooo22: Hateful rhetoric to me just needs to be addressed in general.
[5:13:25] CeIoron: my family is tho
[5:13:25] Hi_Im_Tyrex: Saw your tweet yesterday, congrats on partner!
[5:13:26] zyne9: YEP there are blindspots, otherwise unhateful people could have an inclination they had no idea was racist
[5:13:33] SmileSprite: Is there any scientic study that after accounting for social factors show no difference?
[5:13:34] InconCLEAVEable: @wakewilder is it racist to not like/hate people who decide to conform to the racial stereotypes?
[5:13:36] skool_: if you start with an accusation that person will never change, they will get defensive
[5:13:40] lush_puppies: best comparison i can think of is music, reductive comments made towards different genres and even appraoches to music from other (international) cultures
[5:13:40] prettythiccwbu: i would love to see have a conversation with destiny the bars would give eminem a run for his money
[5:13:47] zenyatta: HUH
[5:13:52] brewke: huh  uhm
[5:13:56] danteimmortal: Who are you to decide tat dawg
[5:13:57] lush_puppies: ?????
[5:13:59] jeremy3186: ironically.. the most suppressed minority in world history is mainly white people (jews)
[5:14:01] zenyatta: what is that question
[5:14:02] ShaldowB: HUH self report
[5:14:05] soulmateueu: people who dont laugh at dad jokes just dont understand the culture.
[5:14:08] CeIoron: I feel as though religon has a very weird correlation to racism
[5:14:11] isJill: YIKES
[5:14:13] IZzwizZY: It's okay to hate stereotypes YEP
[5:14:16] whypxlar: Wtf
[5:14:20] zenyatta: no i legit have no idea what he's trying to ask
[5:14:21] Clown_Balloons: Weirdge
[5:14:25] biggestpiggie: crush the peasantry and oppress the working class
[5:14:28] InconCLEAVEable: @wakewilder no I mean in the sense that "oh im white so I have to like trucks and country music" etc
[5:14:31] BinchMcSwerve: you think black people build this discourse about disliking your stream ?
[5:14:34] JauntyTV: @wakewilder how old are you btw?
[5:14:35] kino168: lol
[5:14:35] Hi_Im_Tyrex: Kappa Kappa Kappa

[5:14:37] goops: @InconCLEAVEable you good ?
[5:14:37] SDbrewer23: HUH
[5:14:43] oooutbreak: its not a  contest @jeremy3186
[5:14:45] jeremy3186: you left the most important word off what I said there wake lol
[5:14:48] yeahright_yeahright: This is spiraling
[5:14:48] dankdaemon: is a black person trying to avoid being stereotyped being racist?
[5:14:55] jeremy3186: @oooutbreak my point is that its not always about race
[5:14:57] alvy8bit: do you think if it's okay to use stereotypes as jokes if they are NOT meant hateful. like white people cant dance or black people LOVE chicken (not my opinions OFC) @wakewilder
